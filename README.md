## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally for development.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or yarn/pnpm)
-   A running instance of the [Go backend application](https://github.com/SachinChandra2022/balkanid-file-vault).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SachinChandra2022/balkanid-vault-frontend.git
cd balkanid-vault-frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all the required packages for the project.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a local environment file by copying the example template.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Open the `.env.local` file. It contains one crucial variable:

-   **`NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT`**: This is the full URL to the running backend's GraphQL API endpoint. For local development, it should be:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080/query
    ```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will now be running and accessible at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**. The page will hot-reload as you make changes to the code.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment to platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Render](https://render.com/).
